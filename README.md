# Deep Learning Training Template

A (relatively) lightweight template primarily using PyTorch Lightning + Hydra template for deep learning projects in a more structured fashion than Colab notebooks typically allow. 

Any user can and should make changes to the `configs` directory in addition to the `src` directory. But there is some solid boilderplate code that hopefully reduces a bit of friction/activation energy needed to get new projects started up. 

Additionally, for folks with Apple Silicon chips, you should be able to prototype smaller models locally before launching training jobs on VMs. Whether prototyping locally or on a VM, you also have the ability to save training artifacts to cloud providers rather than local/virtual storage, so you can access them later from, say, a Colab notebook meaent for analysis. In addition to these artifacts, you can log training metrics to WandB and/or Tensorboard projects. 

This is still a work in progress. Feel free to reach out and contribute if you find it useful!


## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended)
- Optional: CUDA GPU (Linux) or Apple Silicon (MPS)

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

Run commands through the project environment:

```bash
uv run <command>
```

## Train a model

The main training entrypoint is:

```bash
uv run python -m project.train.run <hydra_overrides>
```

For the default causal LM training setup in this repo, use:

- `model=causal_lm`
- `data=modular`
- a trainer config (`trainer=cpu`, `trainer=mps`, `trainer=gpu_1`, or `trainer=ddp`)

### 1) Quick CPU sanity run

```bash
uv run python -m project.train.run \
  model=causal_lm \
  data=modular \
  trainer=cpu \
  trainer.max_epochs=1 \
  data.batch_size=256 \
  trainer.log_every_n_steps=1
```

### 2) Apple Silicon (MPS)

```bash
./scripts/smoke_local.sh
```

Or explicitly:

```bash
uv run python -m project.train.run \
  model=causal_lm \
  data=modular \
  trainer=mps \
  trainer.max_epochs=20 \
  trainer.log_every_n_steps=1
```

### 3) Single CUDA GPU

```bash
./scripts/train_gpu.sh
```

Equivalent command:

```bash
uv run python -m project.train.run \
  model=causal_lm \
  data=modular \
  trainer=gpu_1 \
  trainer.max_epochs=1000 \
  trainer.precision=16-mixed
```

### 4) Multi-GPU DDP

```bash
./scripts/train_ddp.sh
```

Example overriding number of GPUs:

```bash
./scripts/train_ddp.sh trainer.devices=4
```

## Docker

A `docker/Dockerfile` is provided for reproducible GPU training on any CUDA host without fighting driver or Python version mismatches.

### Build

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t training-template .
```

### Run

```bash
docker run --gpus all training-template
```

This runs `./scripts/train_gpu.sh` by default (single GPU, 1000 epochs, fp16). Override the command to use a different script:

```bash
docker run --gpus all training-template ./scripts/train_ddp.sh
```

Or pass Hydra overrides directly:

```bash
docker run --gpus all training-template \
  uv run python -m project.train.run \
    model=causal_lm data=modular trainer=gpu_1 \
    trainer.max_epochs=2000
```

### Cloud sync inside Docker

Pass `RCLONE_CONF_B64` and `RCLONE_DEST` as environment variables — the entrypoint writes the rclone config automatically before training starts:

```bash
docker run --gpus all \
  -e RCLONE_CONF_B64="$(base64 < ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf)" \
  -e RCLONE_DEST="gdrive:training-runs" \
  training-template ./scripts/train_gpu.sh run.project=modular-addition
```

## VM / cloud setup

For running on a cloud GPU instance (RunPod, Lambda, Vast.ai, GCP, etc.):

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> && cd training-template
./scripts/setup_vm.sh
```

This installs `uv`, `rclone`, and all Python dependencies. Then train as usual:

```bash
./scripts/train_gpu.sh
```

### Cloud sync with rclone

Training runs can be automatically synced to cloud storage (Google Drive, S3, GCS, etc.) after each run. This is controlled by the `RCLONE_DEST` environment variable.

One-time setup (on a machine with a browser):

```bash
rclone config  # interactive — follow the OAuth flow for your provider
```

For Google Drive, you can get the OAuth token JSON without a full rclone install by running:

```bash
rclone authorize drive
```

This opens a browser flow and prints a JSON token. When running `rclone config`, choose advanced config and paste the JSON when prompted for the token.

Then base64-encode your finished config for use on the VM:

```bash
base64 < ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
```

For headless VMs, add your rclone config to `.env` so `setup_vm.sh` configures it automatically:

```
RCLONE_CONF_B64="<output of: base64 < ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf>"
RCLONE_DEST="gdrive:training-runs"
```

Then train with `run.project` to organize uploads by project:

```bash
./scripts/train_gpu.sh run.project=modular-addition
```

Each run syncs to `$RCLONE_DEST/<project>/run_artifacts/<run_name>/` both periodically during training (every 50 epochs by default) and after `trainer.fit()` completes. If `RCLONE_DEST` is not set, nothing happens.

### Weights & Biases

1. Get your API key from [wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize).
2. Add it to a `.env` file in the project root (already in `.gitignore`):

   ```
   WANDB_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

3. Run with the `wandb` logger:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/train_gpu.sh logger=wandb logger.project=my-project
   ```

The API key is loaded automatically from `.env` via `python-decouple` whenever `logger=wandb` is set. You can also update the default project name in `configs/logger/wandb.yaml`.

You can combine both cloud sync and W&B:

```bash
RCLONE_DEST=gdrive:training-runs ./scripts/train_gpu.sh logger=wandb logger.project=my-project
```

## Resuming from a checkpoint

To resume a training run from a saved checkpoint, pass `run.ckpt_path`:

```bash
uv run python -m project.train.run \
  model=causal_lm data=modular trainer=mps \
  trainer.max_epochs=3000 \
  run.ckpt_path=/path/to/last.ckpt
```

This restores model weights, optimizer state, epoch counter, and LR scheduler. Checkpoints are saved locally in the Hydra output directory and synced to GDrive (if configured). To resume from a GDrive checkpoint, pull it down first with `rclone copy`.

## Adaptive log frequency

`LitCausalLM` supports adaptive logging to reduce noise during long runs. By default, metrics are logged to W&B/TensorBoard every 10 epochs for the first 100 epochs, then every 100 epochs after that. Console output is always printed regardless.

Control via Hydra overrides on the model config:

- `model.log_every_n_epochs_phase1=10` — log interval for early training
- `model.log_every_n_epochs_phase2=100` — log interval after the boundary
- `model.log_phase_boundary=100` — epoch where the transition happens

Since `ModelCheckpoint` monitors `val_loss`, checkpoints are only saved at logged epochs.

## Logs, checkpoints, and outputs

This project uses Hydra run directories under `outputs/`.

For each run, Hydra creates a directory like:

```text
outputs/2026-02-12/21-12-01/
```

Inside that run directory you will find:

- `resolved_config.yaml`
- `.hydra/` (Hydra config snapshots)
- `checkpoints/` (Lightning checkpoints, via `ModelCheckpoint`)

TensorBoard logs are written to `outputs/<date>/<time>/tb_logs/` alongside checkpoints and configs.

Launch TensorBoard:

```bash
uv run tensorboard --logdir outputs/
```

## Common Hydra overrides

Override any config value from the CLI, for example:

```bash
uv run python -m project.train.run \
  model=causal_lm \
  data=modular \
  trainer=gpu_1 \
  trainer.max_epochs=2000 \
  data.batch_size=2048 \
  run.name=grokking_exp1
```

Useful knobs:

- `trainer.max_epochs=<int>`
- `trainer.devices=<int>` (for DDP)
- `trainer.precision=16-mixed|bf16-mixed|32`
- `data.batch_size=<int>`
- `run.project=<str>` (required for cloud sync folder structure)
- `run.name=<str>`
- `run.ckpt_path=<path>` (resume from checkpoint)
- `model.log_every_n_epochs_phase1=<int>` (default 10)
- `model.log_every_n_epochs_phase2=<int>` (default 100)
- `model.log_phase_boundary=<int>` (default 100)
- `seed=<int>`
